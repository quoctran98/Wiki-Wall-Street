# What is this game?

I keep calling this **"the stock market game but for Wikipedia articles"**
but it turns out that not a lot of people know what 
[the stock market game](https://www.marketwatch.com/games) is
-- it's a game where you have fake money that you can use to buy and sell fake stocks,
which track the value of real stocks. I played it in twelfth grade for a week as the only part of
my "economics unit" in my history class, which is why I'm bad with money 
and spending like $15 a month to host this thing.

Here, you have fake money to **buy and sell Wikipedia article "stocks"**
and the value of the stocks is based on the number of **page views** that the article gets that day.
If you're able to **predict trends in the popularity** of Wikipedia articles, you'll make more (fake) money!

Oh also, **Wikipedia only updates their pageviews data once a day.**
I'm not quite sure when, but it seems like it happens between 6PM and 10PM Pacific Time.
It's also not super consistent and not all pageviews data are updated at the same time!

# How do I play?
