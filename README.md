# What is this game?

I keep calling this **"the stock market game but for Wikipedia articles"**
but it turns out that not a lot of people know what 
[the stock market game](https://www.marketwatch.com/games) is
-- it's a game where you have fake money that you can use to buy and sell fake stocks,
which track the value of real stocks. I played it in twelfth grade for a week as the only part of
my "economics unit" in my history class, which is why I'm bad with money 
and spending like $15 a month to host this thing.
